I'm currently leading a team of 'intrapreneurs' under SRIB's C-Lab initiative. Prior to that I worked in the Samsung-Keyboard team in Multimedia Depth Technology division in  Advanced Technology Labs (ATL).

I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in">IIT Kanpur</a> with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2017, where I worked with <a href="http://tanayag.com/Home.html">Prof. Tanaya Guha</a> on the problem of Online Face Clustering.

Going forward I would like to build intelligent solutions which can impact people's lives in a positive way. I'm especially fascinated by utilization of technology to solve important problems in India.
